    <p style="color:aquamarine;"> The degree I am looking towards is CIT with an emphasis on Cybersecurity. </p>
    <p style="color:forestgreen;"> Hobbies: play tennis/pickleball, writing poetry, hiking, baking, learning to cook, going to the temple, family time, spending time with roomates and friends, playing games, going for walks, camping, and learning new things. </p> 
    <p style="color:aquamarine;"> I have been a member of the church my whole life. My favorite scriptures would have to be Helaman 5:12 or 1 Nephi 3:7.</p>
